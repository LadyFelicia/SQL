**This SQL showcases my querying of the database called BIT_DB, which contains several tables to measure the collected data about the customer and order data.**

-- 1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

SELECT COUNT(orderID),Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales;

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.customers;

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cus
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON cus.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

SELECT DISTINCT MIN(price),Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1;

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

SELECT DISTINCT ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price) as revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales;

SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales;

SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.customers;

SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(cus.acctnum),AVG(Quantity*price) AS Avgamountspent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cus
ON feb.orderID=cus.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity >2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
